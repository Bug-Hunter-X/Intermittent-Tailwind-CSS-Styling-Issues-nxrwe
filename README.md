# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Issues

This repository demonstrates a problem where Tailwind CSS styles are not consistently applied to certain components, even when the configuration and implementation appear correct.  The issue is particularly perplexing because there are no errors reported in the development process, leading to difficulty in debugging.

## Problem Description

Despite following Tailwind CSS best practices (including proper configuration, imports, and class usage), some components fail to receive expected styles.  The behavior seems random; some styles work correctly, while seemingly identical implementations within other components fail.  No errors appear in browser console or during the build process.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the development server.
4. Observe the inconsistencies in styling across different components, as highlighted in `bug.html`.

## Solution

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.html`, addresses the issue by carefully reviewing and reorganizing the order and nesting of HTML elements, as well as verifying the specificity of Tailwind classes and ensuring no conflicting CSS is inadvertently overriding Tailwind's styles.  Addressing these issues will usually resolve the problem.
